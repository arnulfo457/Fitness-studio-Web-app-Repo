# Fitness-studio-Web-app-Repo

•	This project was developed in a team setting which we developed a web application for a fitness studio. The web application presents an administrator and User interface. The administrator is allowed to see all user payments and the User can choose the desired classes, fill out the payment form and make the payment, in this way their purchase and user creation data will be stored and persisted in MongoDB.

•	Use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM, MongoDB, Node.js and Express.
•	The front end of the application consisted of 5 pages, Home page, Schedule of classes page, Cart page, Login page and Admin Interface.
•	The server side of the application consisted of the logic for managing the request-response cycle from a client, data persistence with MongoDB and authentication/authorization access control.
•	The database of the application was designed to persist information about the users in the system, the classes offered by the fitness studio, the classes that a logged-in user has in their cart, and the payments made by all users in the web application.
